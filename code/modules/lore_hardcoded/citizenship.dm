	desc = "Born from the cradle of humanity, the Orion Confederation is a coalition of human worlds spanning much of the space of the Orion Spur. \
	A constitutional government, the Orion Confederation was built from the remains of Terra's pre-space governments, and the semi-independent \
	colonies of Luna and Mars. \
	The largest megacorporations in the galaxy are predominantly human-centric, new frontiers are established on a regular basis by OriCon's \
	explorers, and territories solidify with every passing year. Today the Orion Confederation stands as the cultural center \
	of the galaxy, with it's megacorporations bringing untold prosperity to the galaxy... along with untold toil and struggle. \
	The Orion Confederation's hold on it's native megacorps is always tenuous; these major entities are almost left to their own affairs, \
	especially in the aftermath of the Phoron Wars, in regards to one of it's flagship corporations: NanoTrasen."
